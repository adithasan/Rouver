# Rouver-Platformer

This is a simple platformer built using the Unity game engine. This was done as practice to get my feet wet with Unity game and mobile development. Most of the scripting was done in C# using the Unity scripting API and all visual elements were sourced from the Asset Store in the Unity website. An android and an iOS build was compiled and tested.  

Possible improvements in the future may include:  
1. More complicated movements for the sprites  
2. Better UI elements  
3. more intuitive controls  
4. More levels and increasing difficulty.

Note: One of the skyboxes are missing from the project file. When opening project in Unity, apply one of the available skyboxes in the lighting tab to obtain a background.
